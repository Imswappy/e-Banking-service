Project Title: Banking System using OOP

Synopsis:
The Banking System project is an object-oriented programming (OOP) implementation that simulates a banking system. It allows users to create multiple bank accounts, perform various operations such as deposits, withdrawals, viewing balances, and transaction history. Additionally, the system supports interest calculation and fund transfers between accounts. The project follows a modular and organized structure using classes and inheritance.

Project Details:
1. User Class:
   - Represents a user and holds personal details such as name, age, and gender.
   - Allows adding multiple bank accounts associated with the user.
   - Provides functionality to switch between bank accounts.

2. BankAccount Class:
   - Represents a bank account and stores details like the account number, balance, and transaction history.
   - Supports operations such as deposit, withdrawal, viewing balance, and transaction history.
   - Calculates and adds interest to the account balance.
   - Enables fund transfers between accounts.

3. Main Program:
   - Takes user input to create user instances and perform account operations.
   - Provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the banking system.
   - Validates inputs, checks account balances, and updates balances accordingly.

4. File Structure:
   - main.py: Contains the main program logic.
   - readme.txt: This file (or any other format) that contains the project synopsis and details.

5. How to Run:
   - Ensure Python is installed on your system.
   - Execute the main.py file in a Python environment.
   - Follow the menu options to create user accounts, switch between accounts, perform operations, calculate interest, and transfer funds.

6. Note:
   - This project is for educational purposes and may not cover all real-world banking system functionalities.
   - It serves as a demonstration of OOP concepts and implementation.
